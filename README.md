# Shall We Play?

Shall We Play? is a not-so-featureful [Elm](https://elm-lang.org) example project for scheduling game nights with your friends. It is the example project for a two part article titled ["FaunaDB, GraphQL, and Elm, A Tutorial for JAMstack"](https://dev.to/dirkbj/faunadb-graphql-and-elm-a-tutorial-for-jamstack-part-1-57f8). This project's master branch represents the starting point project for the article. By following the instructions in the article, you will use GraphQL, FaunaDB, and Elm to tie this project into a serverless, backend data store and make it more secure.

You can access a [deployed version of this starting project](https://stoic-tereshkova-0e1d9c.netlify.app) and take a look around.

We hope you find the article and project useful.

## Instructions

We recommend you fork this project, create a branch off of master, and follow along with the article.
